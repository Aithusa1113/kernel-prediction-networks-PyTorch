## Kernel Prediction  Networks and Multi-Kernel Prediction Networks
Reimplement of [Burst Denoising with Kernel Prediction Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.02327.pdf) and [Multi-Kernel Prediction Networks for Denoising of Image Burst](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.05392.pdf) by using PyTorch.

The partial work is following [https://github.com/12dmodel/camera_sim](https://github.com/12dmodel/camera_sim).

## TODO
Write the documents.

## Requirements
- Python3
- PyTorch >= 1.0.0
- Scikit-image
- Numpy
- TensorboardX (needed tensorflow support)

## How to use this repo?
The repo. supports multiple GPUs to train and validate, and the default setting is multi-GPUs. In other words, the pretrained model is obtained by training on multi-GPUs.

- If you want to restart the train process by yourself, the command you should type is that
```angular2html
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=x,y train_eval_sym.py --cuda --mGPU -nw 4 --config_file ./kpn_specs/kpn_config.conf --restart
```
If no option of `--restart`, the train process could be resumed from when it was broken.

- If you want to evaluate the network by pre-trained model directly, you could use
```angular2html
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=x,y train_eval_syn.py --cuda --mGPU -nw 4 --eval
```
If else option `-ckpt` is choosen, you can select the other models you trained.

- Anything else.
  - The code for single image is not released now, I will program it in few weeks.
